# Smile Snap Wave Stop
This repository contains all the files used for my Python project as a Python programming intern at InternPe. The project focuses on smile detection using OpenCV and takes screenshots accordingly. Additionally, it features hand detection to terminate the screenshot program effectively. Explore the collection of files for an in-depth look at the project's development and implementation.

## Structure of the Repository
1. [`SmileSnapStop.py`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SmileSnapWaveStop/blob/main/SmileSnapStop.py) : This file comprises the complete code used in the project, incorporating both smile detection using Haar cascade algorithm and hand detection using Mediapipe library.
2. [`FaceSmileDetection.py`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SmileSnapWaveStop/blob/main/FaceSmileDetection.py) : This file contains the specific code for face and smile detection using the [`Haar cascade`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SmileSnapWaveStop/tree/main/CVLibraries) algorithm. It utilizes OpenCV to identify and capture smiles in images or video streams.
3. [`HandDetection.py`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SmileSnapWaveStop/blob/main/HandDetection.py) : This file is dedicated to hand detection using the powerful Mediapipe library. It enables the program to recognize hand gestures and effectively terminate the screenshot process.

## Running the Programs
